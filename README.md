# nothingIsWorking

Here is my portfolio...this was more ambitious than I thought it would be...
for that reason, it's not as "finished" as I was aiming for...

On the bright side, I feel its all doable. so theres that. 

The main site is separated into sections:

title:
  just says who I am and what I do... make and be edgy... 
  still thinkng of better baner photos so that subtitle is readable. but that will happen eventually.
  might even make a pin that matches the color scheme, but thats only if i finish other parts of the site frst.
  
projects:
  slight preview of the type of projects I've indulged in. right now, what im aiming to do is to move down the card titles so that
  they aline with the bottom of the cards, but until that happens, I like the idea of having some of the cards transfom into alt 
  photos (look at jewelr metals and paques) 
  Another "to do" is to find better photos so text is readable (look at jewelry metals)
  
about me:
  says who I am and what I do (but with more words). will eventually add a link to my resume there and probably an inspirations page... really debating the inspirations page... we'll see how the resume link turns out first
  
contact me:
  self explainitory, a lot of the contact me examples I seen didnt really make sense on how they worked, but I found one that Id like to try and incorperate. until then, the lables are where they need to be (slight adjustments may come though)
  also might add my social media tags so that people can stalk my progress on projects. 
  
  feel free to leave comments questions or concerns on the code or here on git. 
  
  will add wireframes soon.
